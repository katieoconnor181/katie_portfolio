## Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective
This project addressed Swire Coca-Cola's challenge of managing unexpected maintenance downtime, which impacts their production efficiency and revenue. The primary objective was to develop predictive tools for analyzing maintenance data, forecasting future trends, and identifying potential anomalies. These insights would empower the company to make data-driven decisions and improve operational planning, and ultimately aim to reduce maintenance costs.

## Our group's solution to the business problem
Our solution leveraged time series modeling, primarily using Prophet, to forecast maintenance times and trends. We then focused on detecting anomalies within the data to identify potential inefficiencies. The project culminated in a dynamic dashboard that visualized maintenance trends and sent alerts for anomalies, providing actionable insights for proactive decision-making.

## Contribution to the Project
I aided in initial EDA, as well as extensive exploration of time series models using Prophet (also comparing to hybrid time-series models), with a focus on analyzing trends by production location. My contributions also included extensive write-ups for the notebooks, and playing a major role in developing the projectâ€™s final presentation.

## The Business Value of the Solution
The solution offered a dual advantage: reducing unexpected maintenance downtime through anomaly detection and improving planning accuracy with predictive insights. The dashboard enabled Swire Coca-Cola to visualize trends and receive alerts for anomalies in real time, translating into cost savings, enhanced operational efficiency, and informed resource allocation.

## Difficulties That Our Group Encountered Along the Way
One challenge was managing the variability in data quality across locations, such as missing or inconsistent entries. Additionally, aligning forecasts with actual data required careful validation and tuning of models to maintain accuracy. We wanted to ensure that what we were creating brought tangible value given the nature of the data set that we were given to work with, and really take into account all of the other variables at play for the company - such as them having access to data that we did not. Finally, ensuring the dashboard effectively communicated complex insights to stakeholders was an iterative process.

## What I Learned in the Project
This project reinforced the importance of aligning analytical techniques with business objectives. I learned how to navigate challenges in time series modeling, such as handling variability across locations and integrating anomaly detection methods. I also learned that it is important to really look at the whole picture of a business problem, including things that we as the data analysts/scientists might not know - and that it will utltimately be an interative process in itself as more information is gathered. The experience also enhanced my skills in communicating insights through dashboards and presentations.
